# Whitepaper
Whitepaper about our POWE vision.

# Base technologies and conceptions:
- Ethereum network.
- ERC20 Token standard
- PoW Token concept, https://github.com/Overtorment/MetaMining
- 0xBitcoin, first useable PoW Token. https://github.com/0xbitcoin/0xbitcoin-token

# PoWEth core features:
- Fair distribution, launched with community announcement.
- OpenSource, everything is transparent. High thrust rate from Blockchain experts.
- Ethereum network backed, Ethereum has ~ 20.000 Nodes worldwide at this moment.
- Cannot be stoped or edited, unless a community supported Hard Fork PoWEth will keep running under the same consensus.

# PoWEth challenges:
- Be accepted&supported by community.
- Find the new ways to integrate it more and more Ethereum blockchain services.(Example: Raiden network for Offchain transactions.)

# Dependency:
- From Ethereum network status and Ethereum gas fee.
